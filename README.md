- 👋 Hey, I’m **Michael Chervenak**, I am working at Small Loan Studio as a programmer and previously at Bitrate Games as a gameplay programmer, , and I am a contractor for two QA companies for AAA games.
    - I am a 2021 graduate from **Rutgers University-Newark**. I earned a bacholars degree *Magna Cum Laude* in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Mathematics**
        - also recognized by the **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**.
      
- 👀 I’m interested in all aspects of **game development**. I use Unreal, Godot, Unity, and custom engines. I focus on mostly C languages (C,C#, C++). I have experience in Java for mobile development and modding Minecraft. I also have experience with python specifically for cloud computing and network related applications. I mainly focus on programming but as a hobby, any artistic
      outlet I try to enjoy often. My favorite is drawing either on paper or digitally drawing, texture design, 3D modeling, and a bit of animation.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any game or non game related open source projects using Unreal, Godot, Unity, or directly C/C++ that require more hands and eyes on them.
