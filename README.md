- 👋 Hey, I’m **Michael Chervenak**, I am an aspiring game developer who is a 2021 graduate from 
      **Rutgers University-Newark**. I earned a bacholars degree *Magna Cum Laude* in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Mathematics**
      which is also recognized by the **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**.
      
- 👀 I’m interested in all aspects of **game development**. I mainly focus on programming but as a hobby, any artistic
      outlet I try to enjoy often. My favorite is drawing which mainly was on paper but I have taken up digital drawing recently,
      texture design, 3D modeling, animations.
- 🌱 I’m currently reviewing my C++ and Unreal Engine knowledge using Udemy. I will also be experimenting with Unreal Engine 5.
      For my game developement classes I have worked on 2D and 3D game engines in C but I want to design one in C++ that can
      utilize both 2D and 3D. I like to stick to open source resources like Vulkan and SDL 2. They are very powerful and I only
      scratched the surface of what can be accomplished with them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects or game projects that require more hands and eyes on them.
