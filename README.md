- 👋 Hey, I’m **Michael Chervenak**, I am working with [P1] as game programmer and I also do contract work for two QA companies.
    - I am a 2021 graduate from **Rutgers University-Newark**. I earned a bacholars degree *Magna Cum Laude* in **Computer Science** with a minor in **Mathematics**
        - also recognized by the **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**.
      
- 👀 I’m interested in all aspects of **game development**. I mainly focus on programming but as a hobby, any artistic
      outlet I try to enjoy often. My favorite is drawing which mainly was on paper but I have taken up digital drawing,
      texture design, 3D modeling, and a bit of animation.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently reviewing my **C++** and **Unreal Engine** knowledge using **Udemy**. I will also be experimenting with **Unreal Engine 5**.
      For my game developement classes I have worked on 2D and 3D game engines in **C** but I want to design one in **C++** that can
      utilize both 2D and 3D. I like to stick to open source resources like **Vulkan** and **SDL 2**. They are very powerful and I only
      scratched the surface of what can be accomplished with them.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects or game projects using Unreal, Unity, or directly C/C++ that require more hands and eyes on them. Currently contributing to [P1], People First Virtual Civilization Initiative as a game programmer using Unity.
